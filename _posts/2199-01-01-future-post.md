This image is part 4 of the image processing or computer vision process. The process of applying image processing (image processing) or computer vision to objects, which will sometimes attempt to find and count fossils embedded in the Python code's memory, is called the "original image."

"1. Original Image" (Original Image):
After that, it begins with the unexamined part.
The control fossil (resembling a shellfish or brachiopod) is embedded in a dark layer of rock.

"2. Color Mask (14 objects found)" (Color Mask - 14 objects found):
This image shows the result of color masking or thresholding.
The white areas are the cause, the black areas are the expulsions (known fossils), and the black areas are the discarded parts.
In this step, the system detected 14 objects.

"3. Edge Detection (30 objects found)" (Edge Area - 30 objects found):
This image shows the results of using the Edge Detection feature.
The system draws white lines on the edges of objects with multiple color contrasts, showing the edges of fossils, lines on the fossils, and cracks or rocks.
In this step, the system detects 30 objects (or edges).

"4. Final Result (21 objects found)" (Final Result - 21 objects found):
This image is the final result of the process (steps 2 and 3 may be combined).
The original image is displayed in green, in order, with the objects the system concludes are the objects it determines to be the desired object (fossil).
In this final step, the system concludes that 21 target objects were found.

In summary, this image shows the computer attempting to "consider," "count," fossils using various techniques, such as color filtering and edge efficiency. However, it still has problems capturing some of the unclear fossil edges.
